            </div>
            <div>
                    I was in SN Kansagra school in Rajkot, Gujarat, India till my 10th grade. I decided to pursue the Engineering group after receiving 90.33% 
                    in my 10th boards exam.

            <div>
                    I took admission in Charusat University in Gujarat, India after my 12th grade but later I decided I want to go to Canada for further studies so 
                    I gave my IELTS and recieved 7.5 bands and also got admission in Dalhousie University. I applied for visa and got the visa in 3 months. Meanwhile
                    I also continued to study at Charusat university for a year so my studies won't get disturbed when the visa process is going on.

            <div>
                After coming to Halifax, my second task was to seek for a job. The first job offer I recieved was from Zara which is 
                located at Halifax Shopping Center. My experience at Zara gained me the understanding of how the real world actually works. 
                It gave me the knowledge of Customer Service and most importantly, Fundings and Finances. I use to work there as a cashier so 
                I got the knowledge of handling cash very well and also Management.
